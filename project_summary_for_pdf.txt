99 Acres Property Insights & Prediction Project

1. Problem Statement
--------------------
The real estate market in Gurgaon is highly dynamic, with property prices influenced by a multitude of factors such as location, amenities, and market trends. Buyers and investors often struggle to make informed decisions due to the complexity and volume of available data. This project aims to:
- Provide actionable insights into Gurgaon’s property market.
- Predict property prices based on property features.
- Recommend properties tailored to user preferences.

*Why this step?* Defining the problem ensures the project has clear objectives and addresses real user needs, guiding all subsequent steps.

2. Data Collection & Description
-------------------------------
- **Sources:** Data was sourced from 99acres.com, focusing on properties in Gurgaon.
- **Files:** The dataset includes flats, houses, and merged property data, with features such as location, area, price, number of bedrooms, amenities, and more.
- **Data Files:** `flats.csv`, `houses.csv`, `gurgaon_properties.csv`, etc.

*Why this step?* Collecting and understanding the data is foundational. Knowing what data is available and its structure is crucial for effective analysis and modeling.

3. Data Preprocessing
---------------------
- **Cleaning:** Removed duplicates, handled inconsistent entries, and standardized formats.
- **Missing Value Imputation:** Used statistical methods and domain knowledge to fill missing values.
- **Outlier Treatment:** Detected and treated outliers using statistical techniques to ensure robust modeling.
- **Merging:** Combined flats and houses data for unified analysis.

*Why this step?* Raw data is often messy. Preprocessing ensures data quality, which is essential for reliable analysis and model performance.

4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
----------------------------------
- **Univariate Analysis:** Explored distributions of key features (e.g., price, area, bedrooms).
- **Multivariate Analysis:** Examined relationships between variables (e.g., price vs. area, location trends).
- **Visualization:** Used histograms, boxplots, scatter plots, and heatmaps to uncover patterns.

*Why this step?* EDA helps uncover hidden patterns, trends, and anomalies, guiding feature engineering and model selection.

5. Feature Engineering & Selection
----------------------------------
- **Feature Creation:** Derived new features such as price per square foot, proximity to landmarks, and amenity scores.
- **Feature Scaling:** Applied normalization and standardization to numerical features for model compatibility.
- **Feature Selection:** Used statistical tests and model-based methods to select the most relevant features, reducing dimensionality and improving model performance.

*Why this step?* Good features are key to model success. Engineering and selecting the right features improves accuracy and interpretability.

6. Model Building & Selection
-----------------------------
- **Baseline Models:** Established baseline performance using simple regression models.
- **Advanced Models:** Implemented and compared multiple algorithms (e.g., Ridge Regression) to improve prediction accuracy.
- **Model Evaluation:** Used metrics such as RMSE and R² to assess model performance and select the best model.

*Why this step?* Building and evaluating different models ensures the best possible predictive performance for the problem at hand.

7. Price Prediction Module
--------------------------
- **Pipeline:** Built a prediction pipeline that takes user input and outputs estimated property prices.
- **Deployment:** Integrated the model into a Streamlit web app for real-time predictions.

*Why this step?* Making the model accessible through a user-friendly interface allows end-users to benefit from the predictive engine.

8. Recommender System
---------------------
- **Personalization:** Developed a recommendation engine using cosine similarity to suggest properties based on user preferences and property features.
- **Integration:** Embedded the recommender in the web app for seamless user experience.

*Why this step?* Personalized recommendations enhance user engagement and help users discover relevant properties efficiently.

9. Insights & Visualization
---------------------------
- **Key Insights:** Identified trends such as high-demand sectors, price hotspots, and feature importance.
- **Interactive Visualizations:** Provided users with dynamic charts and word clouds to explore the data.

*Why this step?* Visual insights make complex data understandable and actionable for users.

10. Conclusion
--------------
This project delivers a comprehensive analytical and predictive solution for Gurgaon’s real estate market, empowering users to make informed decisions through data-driven insights, price predictions, and personalized recommendations.

*Why this step?* Summarizing the project highlights its value and impact, and provides closure for stakeholders.
